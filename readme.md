# Golang Leetcode Solutions

Welcome to the Golang Leetcode Solutions repository! This project contains a collection of coding solutions for problems from Leetcode, all implemented in Go. These solutions are intended to help new learners and seasoned developers alike to understand problem-solving in Go and prepare for technical interviews.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

```bash
go get -u github.com/deepjyotk/Golang-leetcode-solutions
```

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepjyotk/Golang-leetcode-solutions.git
cd Golang-leetcode-solutions
go build
```

Run the following command to execute a solution:

```bash
cd ./problem_name
go run problem_name.go
go test
```

## Usage

Each folder in the repository corresponds to a specific problem on Leetcode. Each folder contains at least one `.go` file that implements the solution to the problem. Here is an example of how you might use the solutions:

1. Navigate to the problem folder.
2. Read the solution or improve it.
3. Run the program to see the solution in action.
